# Real-Time Auction Platform

## Overview
This project is a real-time auction platform where users can create auctions, bid on items, buy products, sell, and view bidders. The platform is developed using a modern tech stack to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration.
- **Create Auctions:** Users can create new auctions with item details and images.
- **Bid on Items:** Real-time bidding with instant updates.
- **Buy Products:** Option to buy items immediately if the "Buy Now" option is available.
- **Sell Items:** Users can list their items for auction.
- **View Bidders:** Track bidders and bidding history for each auction.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React JS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PgAdmin (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage:** Firebase (for images)

## Architecture
1. **Frontend (React JS):**
   - Provides a responsive and dynamic user interface.
   - Handles user interactions and communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

2. **Backend (Spring Boot):**
   - Manages business logic and processes requests from the frontend.
   - Connects to the PostgreSQL database for data management.
   - Integrates with Firebase for image storage.

3. **Database (PgAdmin - PostgreSQL):**
   - Stores user data, auction details, bids, and transaction history.
   - Ensures data consistency and integrity.

4. **Storage (Firebase):**
   - Stores images related to auction items.
   - Provides secure and scalable storage.

4. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Configure database settings in `application.properties`.
   - Build and run the Spring Boot application:
     ```
     mvn clean install
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

5. **Firebase Setup:**
   - Configure Firebase for image storage.
   - Update Firebase credentials in the backend for image upload functionality.
